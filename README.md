# Infinity Drive

A space-based idle game built around exploration of the solar system and other star systems in the galaxy.

Written using HTML, Javascript and CSS. Heavy use of HTML5's canvas, allowing a more graphical style of browser based idle game.
Minimal use of general libraries including jQuery etc... favouring minimalistic tailored libraries.
